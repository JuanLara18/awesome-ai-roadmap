## Core Concepts

### Image Classification

The foundational CV task — identifying what's in an image.

| Approach | Description |
|---|---|
| CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt) | Classic deep learning approach, still strong |
| Vision Transformers (ViT) | Applying transformer architecture to images |
| Transfer Learning | Using pretrained models on custom datasets |
| Data Augmentation | Random crops, flips, color jitter, Mixup, CutMix |
| Knowledge Distillation | Training small models to mimic large ones |

### Object Detection

Locating and classifying multiple objects in an image.

| Model | Approach |
|---|---|
| **YOLO (v8, v9, v10, v11)** | Real-time single-shot detection |
| **RT-DETR** | Transformer-based real-time detection |
| **Faster R-CNN** | Two-stage detection, high accuracy |
| **DINO / Grounding DINO** | Open-vocabulary detection with language |
| **Florence-2** | Unified vision-language model for detection |

### Segmentation

Pixel-level understanding of images.

| Type | Description | Key Models |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic Segmentation | Label every pixel by class | DeepLab, SegFormer |
| Instance Segmentation | Separate individual objects | Mask R-CNN, YOLACT |
| Panoptic Segmentation | Combine semantic + instance | Panoptic FPN |
| **Segment Anything (SAM / SAM 2)** | Foundation model for universal segmentation | Zero-shot, promptable |

### Video Understanding

Extending vision to temporal data.

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| Action Recognition | Classifying activities in video |
| Object Tracking | Following objects across frames |
| Video Transformers | TimeSformer, VideoMAE |
| Optical Flow | Estimating motion between frames |

### Vision-Language Models

Bridging vision and language — the frontier of multimodal AI.

| Model | Capability |
|---|---|
| **CLIP** | Zero-shot image classification via text |
| **LLaVA** | Visual question answering, image reasoning |
| **GPT-4V / GPT-4o** | Multimodal understanding and generation |
| **Florence-2** | Unified visual understanding |
| **PaliGemma** | Google's open vision-language model |
