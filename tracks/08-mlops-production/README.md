# MLOps & Production AI

> Taking models from notebooks to reliable, scalable production systems — where the real engineering happens.

**Prerequisites:** Any ML track (you need a model to deploy). Basic familiarity with Docker and cloud platforms is helpful.

## Core Concepts

### Experiment Tracking

Keeping track of what you tried, what worked, and why.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| **MLflow** | Open-source platform for the full ML lifecycle |
| **Weights & Biases (W&B)** | Experiment tracking, visualization, model registry |
| **Trackio** | Lightweight Hugging Face-integrated tracking |
| **Neptune** | Metadata management for ML teams |
| **DVC (Data Version Control)** | Versioning data and models alongside code |

### Model Serving & Deployment

Getting predictions to users in real time.

| Tool | Best For |
|---|---|
| **FastAPI** | Custom REST APIs for ML models |
| **TorchServe** | PyTorch-native serving |
| **Triton Inference Server** | High-performance, multi-framework serving (NVIDIA) |
| **BentoML** | Packaging and deploying ML services |
| **TensorFlow Serving** | TensorFlow model serving |
| **vLLM** | High-throughput LLM serving |
| **Ollama** | Local LLM deployment |
| **Hugging Face Inference Endpoints** | Managed model hosting |

### Containerization & Orchestration

Packaging models for consistent deployment.

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Docker** | Containerize your model and dependencies |
| **Kubernetes** | Orchestrate containers at scale |
| **KServe** | Kubernetes-native model serving |
| **Helm Charts** | Packaging Kubernetes deployments |
| **Docker Compose** | Multi-container local development |

### CI/CD for ML

Automating the ML pipeline from data to deployment.

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Automated Testing | Unit tests for data, models, and pipelines |
| Pipeline Orchestration | Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, Kubeflow Pipelines |
| Automated Retraining | Trigger retraining on data drift or schedule |
| Model Registry | Version and stage models (staging, production) |
| GitHub Actions for ML | CI/CD workflows for ML projects |
| Feature/Training/Serving Skew | Ensuring consistency across environments |

### Monitoring & Observability

Knowing when things go wrong in production.

| Concern | Tools & Techniques |
|---|---|
| Data Drift Detection | Evidently, Great Expectations, Alibi Detect |
| Model Performance Monitoring | Tracking accuracy, latency, throughput over time |
| Logging & Alerting | Prometheus, Grafana, custom dashboards |
| A/B Testing | Comparing model versions in production |
| Shadow Deployment | Running new models alongside old ones without serving |

### Feature Stores

Managing features consistently across training and serving.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| **Feast** | Open-source feature store |
| **Tecton** | Managed feature platform |
| **Hopsworks** | End-to-end ML platform with feature store |

### Cloud ML Platforms

The major cloud providers offer fully managed ML platforms that bundle many of the above concepts into integrated services.

| Platform | Key Service | Strengths |
|---|---|---|
| **AWS** | SageMaker, Bedrock | Largest ecosystem, mature tooling, broadest model access |
| **Google Cloud** | Vertex AI, Gemini API | Strong AutoML, BigQuery integration, TPU access |
| **Microsoft Azure** | Azure ML, Azure OpenAI | Enterprise integration, Microsoft ecosystem, OpenAI partnership |

Each platform handles training, deployment, pipelines, and monitoring differently. For a deep comparison, platform-specific workflows, and lighter alternatives (managed APIs, local deployment), see the dedicated **[End-to-End AI Platforms](../11-end-to-end-platforms/README.md)** track.

### LLMOps

MLOps specific to LLM-powered applications.

| Concern | Solution |
|---|---|
| Prompt Management | Version and test prompts, prompt registries |
| LLM Caching | Cache repeated queries to reduce cost (GPTCache, Redis) |
| Cost Optimization | Model routing, token budgets, smaller models for simple tasks |
| Guardrails | Input/output filtering, content moderation (NeMo Guardrails, Guardrails AI) |
| Evaluation | LLM-as-judge, human evaluation, automated benchmarks |
| Observability | LangSmith, Langfuse, Braintrust, Phoenix for tracing LLM calls |
| Agent Infrastructure | Durable execution, crash recovery, approval gates (Kitaru, Temporal) |

## What's Next?

Ready to ship? See **[End-to-End AI Platforms](../11-end-to-end-platforms/README.md)** for cloud, managed, and local deployment workflows. Then consider the responsibility that comes with deploying AI in **[AI Safety & Ethics](../09-ai-safety-ethics/README.md)**.
