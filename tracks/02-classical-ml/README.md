## Core Concepts

### Supervised Learning

Learning from labeled data to make predictions.

| Algorithm | Type | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | Regression | Continuous predictions, baseline models |
| Logistic Regression | Classification | Binary classification, interpretable models |
| Decision Trees | Both | Interpretable models, feature importance |
| Random Forests | Both | Robust predictions, handling noisy data |
| Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) | Both | Competition-winning tabular data models |
| Support Vector Machines | Both | High-dimensional data, small datasets |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | Both | Simple baselines, non-parametric modeling |
| Naive Bayes | Classification | Text classification, spam filtering |

### Unsupervised Learning

Discovering structure in unlabeled data.

| Algorithm | Purpose |
|---|---|
| K-Means | Cluster data into groups |
| DBSCAN | Density-based clustering, handling noise |
| Hierarchical Clustering | Tree-structured groupings |
| PCA | Dimensionality reduction, visualization |
| t-SNE / UMAP | High-dimensional data visualization |
| Isolation Forest | Anomaly detection |

### Model Evaluation & Selection

How to know if your model is actually good.

| Concept | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| Train/Validation/Test Split | Unbiased performance estimation |
| Cross-Validation | Robust evaluation with limited data |
| Bias-Variance Tradeoff | Why models underfit or overfit |
| ROC/AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 | Classification performance metrics |
| RMSE, MAE, R-squared | Regression performance metrics |
| Confusion Matrix | Detailed classification error analysis |

### Feature Engineering

Often the difference between a mediocre model and a great one.

| Technique | When to Use |
|---|---|
| One-Hot Encoding | Categorical variables |
| Target Encoding | High-cardinality categoricals |
| Feature Scaling (StandardScaler, MinMax) | Distance-based algorithms |
| Polynomial Features | Capturing non-linear relationships |
| Feature Selection (mutual information, RFE) | Reducing dimensionality |
| Handling Imbalanced Data (SMOTE, class weights) | Rare event prediction |

### AutoML

Automating the model selection and tuning process.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| **Auto-sklearn** | Automated scikit-learn pipeline optimization |
| **TPOT** | Genetic algorithm-based pipeline search |
| **Optuna** | Hyperparameter optimization framework |
| **H2O AutoML** | Enterprise-grade AutoML platform |
| **FLAML** | Fast, lightweight AutoML by Microsoft |
