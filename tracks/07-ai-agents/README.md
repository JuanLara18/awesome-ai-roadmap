# AI Agents & Autonomous Systems

> Building AI systems that reason, plan, use tools, and act autonomously — the most transformative application of LLMs.

**Prerequisites:** [NLP & LLMs](../04-nlp-and-llms/README.md) — understanding of LLMs, prompting, and RAG.

## Core Concepts

### Agent Fundamentals

What makes an LLM into an agent: the ability to reason, plan, and act.

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| ReAct Pattern | Interleaving reasoning and actions — think, then act, then observe |
| Tool Use / Function Calling | Letting LLMs invoke external tools (APIs, code, databases) |
| Planning | Breaking complex tasks into subtasks |
| Memory | Short-term (conversation), long-term (persistent knowledge) |
| Observation Loop | Agent acts, observes results, adjusts strategy |

    User["User Query"] --> Think["Reason / Plan"]
    Think --> Act["Use Tool"]
    Act --> Observe["Observe Result"]
    Observe --> Think
    Observe --> Response["Final Response"]
```

### Agent Frameworks

The ecosystem for building agents in 2025-2026.

| Framework | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **LangChain / LangGraph** | Popular framework with graph-based orchestration | Complex multi-step workflows |
| **CrewAI** | Role-based multi-agent framework | Team-based agent collaboration |
| **AutoGen (Microsoft)** | Multi-agent conversation framework | Research, complex reasoning |
| **Smolagents (Hugging Face)** | Lightweight, code-first agents | Simple tool-use agents |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | OpenAI's native agent framework | OpenAI model users |
| **Pydantic AI** | Type-safe agent framework | Production-grade agents |
| **Mastra** | TypeScript agent framework | JS/TS developers |

### Agentic RAG

Going beyond basic RAG — agents that decide what to retrieve and how.

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| Query Decomposition | Breaking complex questions into sub-queries |
| Tool Routing | Choosing between vector search, SQL, web search, APIs |
| Iterative Retrieval | Retrieving, evaluating, and retrieving again if needed |
| Verification | Reranking results, checking citations, fact-checking |
| GraphRAG | Using knowledge graphs for multi-hop reasoning |

> [!TIP]
> Agentic RAG is replacing simple RAG pipelines in production. Instead of one fixed retrieval step, the agent decides dynamically what information it needs.

### Multi-Agent Systems

Multiple agents collaborating to solve complex problems.

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| Orchestrator-Worker | One agent delegates to specialized agents |
| Debate / Critique | Agents challenge each other's outputs |
| Pipeline | Sequential processing through specialized agents |
| Hierarchical | Manager agents supervise teams of worker agents |
| Swarm | Decentralized coordination among peer agents |

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The emerging standard for connecting LLMs to external tools and data.

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| MCP Servers | Expose tools and resources via a standard protocol |
| MCP Clients | LLM applications that connect to MCP servers |
| Tool Discovery | Agents discover available tools dynamically |
| Resource Access | Standardized read access to external data |

### Agent Evaluation

How to measure if your agent actually works.

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Task Completion Rate | Does the agent finish the task? |
| Tool Selection Accuracy | Does it pick the right tools? |
| Efficiency | How many steps does it take? |
| Cost | Token usage and API costs per task |
| Safety | Does it stay within bounds? |
| Benchmarks (SWE-bench, GAIA, AgentBench) | Standardized agent evaluations |
