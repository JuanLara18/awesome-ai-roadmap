# NLP & Large Language Models

> From text processing to building and deploying LLM-powered applications — the hottest area in AI.

**Prerequisites:** [Deep Learning](../03-deep-learning/README.md) — especially the transformer architecture section.

## Core Concepts

### Text Fundamentals

How machines process and represent human language.

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Tokenization | Splitting text into tokens (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece, Tiktoken) |
| Word Embeddings | Word2Vec, GloVe — dense vector representations |
| Contextual Embeddings | BERT-style embeddings that change based on context |
| TF-IDF | Classic term frequency method for text representation |
| Text Preprocessing | Normalization, stopwords, stemming, lemmatization |

### Transformer-Based Models

The zoo of models built on the transformer architecture.

| Model Family | Type | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **BERT** (and RoBERTa, DeBERTa) | Encoder | Classification, NER, semantic similarity |
| **GPT** (2, 3, 4, 4o) | Decoder | Text generation, instruction following |
| **T5 / FLAN-T5** | Encoder-Decoder | Summarization, translation, general NLU |
| **LLaMA / Mistral / Qwen** | Decoder | Open-source text generation |
| **Claude / Gemini** | Decoder | Multimodal, long context, reasoning |

### LLM Fine-Tuning

Adapting foundation models to your specific task.

| Method | Description | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Fine-Tuning** | Update all parameters | When you have lots of data and compute |
| **LoRA / QLoRA** | Low-rank adapters, quantized training | Most practical fine-tuning scenario |
| **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)** | Train on instruction-response pairs | Making models follow instructions |
| **RLHF** | Reinforcement learning from human feedback | Aligning model outputs with preferences |
| **DPO** | Direct preference optimization | Simpler alternative to RLHF |
| **GRPO** | Group relative policy optimization | Efficient preference alignment |

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Grounding LLM outputs in external knowledge.

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Document Chunking | Breaking documents into retrievable pieces |
| Embeddings | Converting text to vectors for similarity search |
| Vector Databases | Storing and querying embeddings (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, Qdrant, FAISS) |
| Retrieval Strategies | Dense retrieval, hybrid search, reranking |
| Generation with Context | Prompting LLMs with retrieved documents |
| Evaluation | Faithfulness, relevance, answer correctness (RAGAS) |

> [!TIP]
> RAG is often the best starting point for LLM applications — it's cheaper than fine-tuning and keeps your data up-to-date without retraining.

### Prompt Engineering & Context Engineering

Getting the most out of LLMs without training.

| Technique | Description |
|---|---|
| System Prompts | Setting model behavior and constraints |
| Few-Shot Learning | Providing examples in the prompt |
| Chain-of-Thought (CoT) | Prompting step-by-step reasoning |
| ReAct | Combining reasoning and actions |
| Structured Output | JSON mode, function calling, grammar-constrained decoding |
| Context Window Management | Long-context strategies, summarization, compression |

### LLM Deployment & Serving

Getting models into production.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **vLLM** | High-throughput serving with PagedAttention |
| **TGI (Text Generation Inference)** | Hugging Face's production inference server |
| **Ollama** | Run LLMs locally with one command |
| **llama.cpp** | CPU-friendly inference with GGUF quantization |
| **SGLang** | Fast structured generation |
| Quantization (GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF) | Making models smaller and faster |
