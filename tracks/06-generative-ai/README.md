# Generative AI

> Creating new content — text, images, audio, video, and code. The technology reshaping every creative industry.

**Prerequisites:** [Deep Learning](../03-deep-learning/README.md). For text generation, also see [NLP & LLMs](../04-nlp-and-llms/README.md).

## Core Concepts

### Image Generation

From GANs to diffusion models — the evolution of AI-generated images.

| Approach | Description | Key Models |
|---|---|---|
| GANs | Generator vs discriminator adversarial training | StyleGAN, BigGAN |
| VAEs | Variational autoencoders for smooth latent spaces | VQ-VAE, DALL-E (v1) |
| Diffusion Models | Iterative denoising from random noise | Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, Midjourney |
| Flow Matching | Optimal transport-based generation | Flux, Stable Diffusion 3 |
| Consistency Models | Few-step generation from diffusion | LCM, SDXL Turbo |

| Component | What It Does |
|---|---|
| U-Net / DiT | The backbone network that predicts noise |
| Text Encoder (CLIP, T5) | Converts text prompts to conditioning vectors |
| VAE | Encodes/decodes between pixel and latent space |
| Scheduler (DDPM, Euler, DPM++) | Controls the denoising process |
| ControlNet / IP-Adapter | Fine-grained control over generation |

### Text Generation

How LLMs generate text, and the techniques that make it work.

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Autoregressive Generation | Predicting one token at a time |
| Sampling Strategies | Temperature, top-k, top-p (nucleus sampling) |
| Beam Search | Finding high-probability sequences |
| Speculative Decoding | Using small models to speed up large ones |
| Structured Generation | Constraining output to valid JSON, code, etc. |

### Audio & Music Generation

| Area | Key Models/Tools |
|---|---|
| Text-to-Speech | Bark, XTTS, StyleTTS 2, Fish Speech |
| Voice Cloning | Real-time voice conversion, speaker embedding |
| Music Generation | Suno, Udio, MusicGen, Stable Audio |
| Audio Understanding | Whisper (transcription), AudioLM |

### Video Generation

The newest frontier — still rapidly evolving.

| Model / Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| Sora (OpenAI) | Long-form video from text prompts |
| Runway Gen-3 | Commercial video generation |
| Kling / Veo | Competitive video generators |
| AnimateDiff | Adding motion to image generation |
| Temporal consistency | The core challenge — keeping videos coherent across frames |

### Code Generation

AI as a programming partner.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| GitHub Copilot | Inline code completion and generation |
| Cursor | AI-native code editor |
| Aider | Terminal-based AI pair programming |
| Code LLMs (CodeLlama, StarCoder, DeepSeek Coder) | Open-source code models |
| Benchmarks (HumanEval, SWE-bench) | Evaluating code generation quality |
