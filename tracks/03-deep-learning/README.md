## Core Concepts

### Neural Network Fundamentals

The building blocks of deep learning.

| Concept | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Perceptron & Multi-Layer Perceptrons | The simplest neural network — understand forward pass |
| Activation Functions (ReLU, GELU, Sigmoid, Tanh) | Non-linearity that makes deep learning work |
| Backpropagation | How networks learn — computing gradients through layers |
| Loss Functions (Cross-Entropy, MSE, Contrastive) | Defining what "good" means for your model |
| Optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, LAMB) | How gradients become parameter updates |
| Regularization (Dropout, Weight Decay, BatchNorm) | Preventing overfitting |

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

The architecture that revolutionized computer vision.

| Architecture | Contribution |
|---|---|
| LeNet / AlexNet | Pioneered deep learning for images |
| VGG | Showed depth matters |
| ResNet | Skip connections, training very deep networks |
| EfficientNet | Compound scaling for efficiency |
| ConvNeXt | Modernizing CNNs with transformer insights |

### Recurrent Networks & Sequences

Processing sequential data — text, time series, audio.

| Architecture | Use Case |
|---|---|
| RNNs | Basic sequence processing |
| LSTMs | Long-range dependencies, time series |
| GRUs | Simplified LSTMs, faster training |
| Seq2Seq + Attention | Machine translation, summarization |
| Temporal Convolutional Networks | Alternative to RNNs for sequences |

### The Transformer Architecture

The architecture that changed everything — the foundation for LLMs, vision transformers, and more.

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Self-Attention | Relating all positions in a sequence |
| Multi-Head Attention | Learning multiple attention patterns |
| Positional Encoding | Injecting sequence order information |
| Layer Normalization | Stabilizing training |
| Encoder-Decoder Structure | Flexible architecture for many tasks |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Understanding transformers deeply is essential for nearly everything in modern AI — LLMs, vision models, multimodal systems, and agents all build on this architecture.

### Training at Scale

Techniques for training large models efficiently.

| Technique | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Mixed Precision Training (FP16/BF16) | Faster training, less memory |
| Gradient Accumulation | Effective larger batch sizes |
| Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) | Multi-GPU training |
| FSDP / DeepSpeed ZeRO | Memory-efficient distributed training |
| Learning Rate Scheduling (Cosine, Warmup) | Better convergence |
| Gradient Checkpointing | Trading compute for memory |
